Final Project for CSET 3100<br>
I decided to change nearly everything about my website.  I changed my background to be more professional and less 
distracting.  I changed the wording around to flow better.  I changed the color of my navigation bar to black. 
I added a white horizontal line to separate the About Me section and the Contact Me section.  I also added a white
horizontal line between the navigation bar and the About Me section.  Overall, I think these changes led to a more
professional and cohesive website that I am proud to have created.
